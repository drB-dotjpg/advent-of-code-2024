# My Advent Of Code repo

Check out [Advent Of Code!](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

## Goals

- Use typescript.
- No AI.
- No external node packages, aside from typing.
- Readable and understandable code, even if that means optimizations come later. Code that works now and is maintainable by others is more important (keep it simple, stupid!)

## Install and run

- Clone this repo
- In the working directory, run `npm i`
- Then run `npm run build`, the build folder should now exist
- To run a day/part, use the following `node build/{day number}/{part1/part2}.js`

### Other notes

Using Node.js 18.20.3 & Typescript 5.2.2

I'm tempted to try other languages too!
